Memory Game for Children
This project is an interactive memory game designed especially for children, aimed at enhancing recognition, concentration, and visual association skills.

Description
"Memory Game for Children" is a card-matching game where the objective is to find all matching card pairs with the fewest attempts. Each level increases in difficulty by adding more cards, presenting a progressive challenge for players.

Features
Progressive Levels: As the player advances, the number of cards increases, offering challenges tailored to different skill levels.
Engaging Visual Interactivity: With animations and visual effects, like a "star shower" upon completing each level, the game provides an engaging and fun experience.
Error Counter: Players can see how many unsuccessful attempts theyâ€™ve made per level, encouraging continuous improvement.
Ranking: Achievements for each level are saved, allowing players to track their progress and compete with themselves.
How to Play
Select your desired difficulty level in the main menu or start the game directly.
Click on cards to reveal them. The goal is to find two matching cards.
If the cards match, they remain revealed. If not, they flip back.
After completing a level, a celebratory animation plays, and you can proceed to the next level.
Repeat the process and improve your score with fewer attempts.
